Rate Your Music is an online collaborative database of music releases and films.
Users can catalog items, assign ratings in a five-star rating system and review them.

In this project I scraped data from https://rateyourmusic.com/charts/top/album/2022/, parsed html file and created pandas table.
After that I analyzed the table in Jupyter Notebook.
